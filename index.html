    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      In the corners of factories and the shadows of machines, there was a man with a camera — capturing industry not as machinery, but as movement, life, and purpose. That man was my father.<br /><br />
      Mr. M. Limkar spent over 20 years photographing industrial spaces across India — long before hashtags, likes, or portfolio websites ever existed. His work spoke silently: of sweat, scale, and strength. Yet, his photographs rarely reached the audience they deserved. He created art in an era where recognition never came — only respect from those who knew.<br /><br />
      As a child, I didn’t fully understand what he was building. I only knew that when he returned from a shoot, he looked fulfilled. Calm. As if he had captured something that would matter later — even if no one noticed now.<br /><br />
      I grew up around tripods and tungsten lights, surrounded by stories my father never spoke, but silently framed. Over time, I began to see. The way he waited for light. The way he respected machines. The way he never rushed a shot. I wasn’t just learning photography. I was inheriting a philosophy.<br /><br />
      And now, years later, I see it clearly: my father wasn’t just a photographer — he was an archivist of dignity in work. Of men in oil-stained uniforms. Of welders mid-spark. Of motion frozen in meaning. He gave industrial spaces the kind of beauty usually reserved for temples or theaters.<br /><br />
      Today, I carry that lens forward. My name is Yash Limkar, and I photograph industry with the same reverence — but with a new voice. I use drones, high-resolution digital systems, lighting control, and post-production tools my father never had access to. But the eye behind the camera? That comes from him.<br /><br />
      This website is more than my portfolio. It’s a second chance — for his legacy to be seen, and for mine to begin.
