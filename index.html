      <h2>The Legacy That Never Came to Light</h2>
      <p>
        In the corners of factories and the shadows of machines, there was a man with a camera — capturing industry not as machinery, but as movement, life, and purpose. That man was my father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. M. Limkar spent over 20 years photographing industrial spaces across India — long before hashtags, likes, or portfolio websites ever existed. His work spoke silently: of sweat, scale, and strength. Yet, his photographs rarely reached the audience they deserved. He created art in an era where recognition never came — only respect from those who knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a child, I didn’t fully understand what he was building. I only knew that when he returned from a shoot, he looked fulfilled. Calm. As if he had captured something that would matter later — even if no one noticed now.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, years later, I see it clearly: my father wasn’t just a photographer — he was an archivist of dignity in work. Of men in oil-stained uniforms. Of welders mid-spark. Of motion frozen in meaning. He gave industrial spaces the kind of beauty usually reserved for temples or theaters.
      </p>

      <p>
        I grew up around tripods and tungsten lights, surrounded by stories my father never spoke, but silently framed. Over time, I began to see. The way he waited for light. The way he respected machines. The way he never rushed a shot. I wasn’t just learning photography. I was inheriting a philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I carry that lens forward. My name is Yash Limkar, and I photograph industry with the same reverence — but with a new voice. I use drones, high-resolution digital systems, lighting control, and post-production tools my father never had access to. But the eye behind the camera? That comes from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is more than my portfolio. It’s a second chance — for his legacy to be seen, and for mine to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every photo I take, there’s an echo of a frame my father once envisioned. And this time, we bring it to light.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a child, I watched him compose frames with obsessive detail. He’d adjust his angle for 20 minutes to capture the exact symmetry of a gearwheel in motion. He taught me to see metal not as cold, but alive — shaped by human hands, powered by human effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site, this work, and every photo I take — it’s not just mine. It’s an echo of his vision. A second attempt at bringing into light what remained in the darkroom far too long.
